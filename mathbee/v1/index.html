      <h2> What do we do? </h2>
      <p> We are a team of mathematics teachers and professors, aiming to make maths fun for students from primary school up till college level! We have designed courses and other learning materials in a way that seems more like games with learning, than teaching. 
         Our games have been designed with the help of the best mathematics educators in the country, who are enthusiastic about making the youth maths-enthusiastic. 
      </p>

      <h2> Our Pedagogy</h2>
	  <img class="center" src="images/2.jpg" alt="Image 2" width="600" height="450">
      <p> 
         Our educators and our programs are designed keeping in mind the <span class="italictext" >5Es of learning - enterprise, expertise, empowerment, empathy and enthusiasm</span>. 
         We have realized that kids end up hating maths because they were never taught how to learn loving maths!
         Hence, we make it our aim to develop some enthusiasm and liking towards the subject before teaching them.

		 <br/>
		 We also aim to understand and show our understanding towards children who are not able to grasp the concepts. To ensure, that we are student centred, we also design courses of every level, with most challenges kept in mind.
         We also believe in <span class="boldtext italictext">QUALITY OVER QUANITITY</span>, so even if we have shorter lessons, we have more enriched quantity. 
         We also offer group, real time, classes, wehrestudenst of the same level of understanding of maths, meet at a common time (online, presently), and there is a discussion-based learning where children help each other out, clear their doubts with the tutors, and of course, have fun
