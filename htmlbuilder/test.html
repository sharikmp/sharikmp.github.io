            <div>
               <ul>
                  <li>It is incumbent on us to <b>ensure value-education</b> that makes the younger generation understands and appreciates not only its own religious traditions but also those of the other religions in the country.</li>
               </ul>
               <ul>
                  <li>Instead of getting Polarised, spread the message of brotherhood and<b> boycott the political influences</b>.&nbsp;</li>
               </ul>
               <ul>
                  <li>Look at the history of our Indian society where we are living with peace and love instead of coming under the <b>influence of hatred on social media.</b></li>
               </ul>
               <ul>
                  <li>The best approach to nurture secularism is to <b>expand religious freedom rather than strictly practicing state neutrality.</b></li>
