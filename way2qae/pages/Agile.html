                "ans": "<div><p>Story estimation is a critical part of Agile development methodology and is used to estimate the amount of time and effort required to complete a specific user story. As a software tester, it is important to understand how story estimation works and how it affects the overall development process.</p><p>In Agile development, a user story is a short, simple description of a feature or requirement from the perspective of the end-user. These user stories are used to drive the development process, and they are typically broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Story estimation involves assigning an estimate, usually in points or time, to each of these smaller tasks, based on the complexity of the task and the level of effort required to complete it.</p><p>The story estimation process typically involves the development team, including software testers, who work together to estimate the effort required to complete each task. Estimation is done in a collaborative manner, and each team member provides their input based on their knowledge and expertise. The team then reaches a consensus on the estimate for each task.</p><p>One common method used for story estimation is planning poker. In planning poker, each team member is given a set of cards with numbers on them representing the effort required to complete a task. The team members then take turns selecting a card and presenting their estimate. The estimates are then discussed, and the team members continue to select cards until a consensus is reached.</p><p>The estimates assigned to each task are used to determine the overall timeline for the project and to prioritize the work to be done. Story estimation helps the team to identify potential roadblocks early on and to make adjustments to the development process as necessary to ensure that the project stays on track.</p><p>In summary, story estimation is an essential part of Agile development methodology that involves assigning estimates to individual tasks based on the level of effort required to complete them.
